# Simple Blockchain In PHP 

## Understanding Blockchain

A blockchain works by creating a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record of transactions through the use of cryptographic hashing, chaining, decentralization, and a consensus mechanism. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing a more secure and efficient way to manage and verify data.
## Understanding The Project 

This is a simplified PHP implementation of a blockchain for educational purposes.  It demonstrates the core concepts of a blockchain, including blocks, hashing, and the chain structure.  **This implementation is NOT suitable for production use** as it lacks critical features for scalability.

## Features
* Image Data 
* Basic block structure with data, timestamp, previous hash, and hash.
* Proof-of-Work (PoW) system using a simple hash target.
* Chain validation.
* Adding new blocks to the chain.

## Limitations

* **Image Type:** The images provided should only be png. 
* **Security:**  This implementation is highly vulnerable and should not be used with sensitive data or in any production environment. It lacks proper cryptographic security measures.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4 or higher

## Installation
